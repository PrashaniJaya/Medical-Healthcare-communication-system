However, emergency contraceptive pills can cause hormonal changes that may delay her period. It's not uncommon for periods to be irregular after taking such a pill. I recommend waiting a few more days, and if her period still hasn't started or if there are any concerns, she should take a pregnancy test or consult a healthcare professional for further evaluation.\n\nThis information is for educational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice."}, {'query': 'Hello doctor,I took an I-pill after 48 hours of intercourse.

This is not necessarily a sign of pregnancy, especially since you took the pill within the recommended time frame. Spotting can occur up to 14 days after taking the I-pill.
